void initialize_usb(void);

#pragma code

/*
 * The USB firmware stack will call the callback functions USBCBxxx() in 
 * response to certain USB related events.  For example, if the host PC is
 * powering down, it will stop sending out Start of Frame (SOF) packets to
 * your device.  In response to this, all USB devices are supposed to decrease
 * their power consumption from the USB Vbus to <2.5mA each.  The USB module
 * detects this condition (which according to the USB specifications is 3+ms
 * of no bus activity/SOF packets) and then calls the USBCBSuspend() function.
 *
 * You should modify these callback functions to take appropriate actions for
 * each of these conditions.  For example, in the USBCBSuspend(), you may wish
 * to add code that will decrease power consumption from Vbus to <2.5mA (such
 * as by clock switching, turning off LEDs, putting the microcontroller to
 * sleep, etc.).  Then, in the USBCBWakeFromSuspend() function, you may then
 * wish to add code that undoes the power saving things done in the
 * USBCBSuspend() function.
 * 
 * The USBCBSendResume() function is special, in that the USB stack will not
 * automatically call this function.  This function is meant to be called
 * from the application firmware instead.  See the additional comments near
 * the function.

 *
 * Overview:    The USB specifications allow some types of USB
 *              peripheral devices to wake up a host PC (such
 *		as if it is in a low power suspend to RAM state).
 *		This can be a very useful feature in some
 *		USB applications, such as an Infrared remote
 *		control	receiver.  If a user presses the "power"
 *		button on a remote control, it is nice that the
 *		IR receiver can detect this signalling, and then
 *		send a USB "command" to the PC to wake up.
 *
 *		The USBCBSendResume() "callback" function is used
 *		to send this special USB signalling which wakes
 *		up the PC.  This function may be called by
 *		application firmware to wake up the PC.  This
 *		function should only be called when:
 *
 *		1.  The USB driver used on the host PC supports
 *		    the remote wakeup capability.
 *		2.  The USB configuration descriptor indicates
 *		    the device is remote wakeup capable in the
 *		    bmAttributes field.
 *		3.  The USB host PC is currently sleeping,
 *		    and has previously sent your device a SET
 *		    FEATURE setup packet which "armed" the
 *		    remote wakeup capability.
 *
 *		This callback should send a RESUME signal that
 *              has the period of 1-15ms.
 *
 * Note:        Interrupt vs. Polling
 *              -Primary clock
 *              -Secondary clock ***** MAKE NOTES ABOUT THIS *******
 *              > Can switch to primary first by calling USBCBWakeFromSuspend()
 *
 *                  The modifiable section in this routine should be changed
 *                  to meet the application needs. Current implementation
 *                  temporary blocks other functions from executing for a
 *                  period of 1-13 ms depending on the core frequency.
 *
 *                  According to USB 2.0 specification section 7.1.7.7,
 *                  "The remote wakeup device must hold the resume signaling
 *                  for at lest 1 ms but for no more than 15 ms."
 *                  The idea here is to use a delay counter loop, using a
 *                  common value that would work over a wide range of core
 *                  frequencies.
 *                  That value selected is 1800. See table below:
 *                  ==========================================================
 *                  Core Freq(MHz)      MIP         RESUME Signal Period (ms)
 *                  ==========================================================

 *                  ==========================================================
 *                  * These timing could be incorrect when using code
 *                    optimization or extended instruction mode,
 *                    or when having other interrupts enabled.
 *                    Make sure to verify using the MPLAB SIM's Stopwatch
 *                    and verify the actual signal on an oscilloscope.
