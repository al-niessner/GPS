<h1>This is a ground up DIY GPS unit that I use for hiking.</h1>

I got very annoyed with my current GPS and when I went looking for a new one, I got even more irritated that none of them allowed me to play with data or maps in a way that useful to me. It was useful to them because I had to keep paying them for more and newer services. So, I decided to just build my own and be done with them all.

In some ways, this git repository is a story of how I designed and built my GPS unit. It came in fits and starts because there where a lot of distractions along the way. However, I am hoping to have it finished and fully functional before the 2012 hiking season gets into full swing.
